# @bindings/debttoken JS

JS library for interacting with [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) smart contract `@bindings/debttoken` via Soroban RPC.

This library was automatically generated by Soroban CLI using a command similar to:

```bash
soroban contract bindings ts \
  --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022" \
  --id CAY2AGOEOHYA4QUHOYZVQWSAAVLMIDRQKDDC2KHY6YTD5DMJEI2CVOWV \
  --name @bindings/debttoken
```

It uses these settings by default, but you can override them with environment variables if you need to:

- **Contract ID**: `CAY2AGOEOHYA4QUHOYZVQWSAAVLMIDRQKDDC2KHY6YTD5DMJEI2CVOWV`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_BINDINGS_DEBTTOKEN_CONTRACT_ID` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_BINDINGS_DEBTTOKEN_CONTRACT_ID`

- **RPC endpoint**: `https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`

- **Network Passphrase**: `Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`

# Use it

You don't need to publish this library to NPM to use it. You can add it to your project's `package.json` using a file path:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bindings/debttoken": "./path/to/this/folder"
  }
}
```

Then you can import it into your editor and see inline documentation for all of its exports:

```js
import * as bindingsDebttoken from "@bindings/debttoken"

bindingsDebttoken.|
```

As long as your editor is configured to show JavaScript/TypeScript documentation, you can pause your typing at that `|` to get a list of all exports and inline-documentation for each. It exports a separate [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) function for each method in the smart contract, with documentation for each generated from the comments the contract's author included in the original source code.
